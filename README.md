# OtherPackages

This is a repository of several R packages that I wrote in the past, which are not available at either CRAN 
or Bioconductor. 

It contains tar.gz and zip files for: 

CGHtest: Statistical permutation tests for called aCGH data

dnaCplusT (with Kyung In Kim): Clustering plus hierarchical testing for aCGH data

NoWaves: Smoothing waves for tumor aCGH profiles
